				<p>Our Team & Structure</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="subtitle">
				Success in the hospitality sector is built on the foundation of a robust team. 
				At the helm of our organization is the Head Manager, a beacon of leadership guiding the ship. 
				This individual's vast experience ensures that the cafe operates at its peak potential. 
				Assisting in this endeavor are four pivotal pillars. 
				With this structure and strategy, our Bingsu cafe aims to become a melting pot of Korean tradition and American modernity.
			</div>
			
				<div id="operationManager" class="section-content">
					<h2>Operation Manager</h2>
						<p>• This individual ensures that every operational aspect of our cafe runs smoothly. From sourcing the finest ingredients to the final presentation of the Bingsu, the operation manager ensures quality at every step.</p>
						<p>• While the cafe offers a range of products, those influenced by Western culture are the operation manager's primary responsibility. This ensures that even the most discerning American customer feels catered to.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="kProductManager" class="section-content">
					<h2>K-Product Manager</h2>
						<p>• Our Bingsu is the star of our cafe. The K-product manager specializes in this delicacy, ensuring its traditional essence is maintained while making innovative tweaks to suit the local palate.</p>
						<p>• Bingsu remains our star attraction. The K-product manager, with a deep understanding of this dessert, ensures that its authenticity remains untouched. From sourcing the perfect shaved ice to the final garnishing, every Bingsu served is a testament to our commitment to quality.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="financialManager" class="section-content">
					<h2>Financial Manager</h2>
						<p>• Every business decision has financial implications. Our financial manager keeps a close watch on the monetary flow, ensuring that the business remains profitable while still offering value to our customers.</p>
						<p>• From budgeting for new ventures to salary dispersions, every penny that flows in and out of our establishment is monitored by our financial manager. Their expertise ensures that our business remains fiscally healthy.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="resourcesManager" class="section-content">
					<h2>Resources Manager</h2>
						<p>• A cafe is only as good as its staff. The HR manager is entrusted with the task of hiring the best, especially focusing on native-born Americans to bring about the aforementioned localization. Training and welfare of our staff also fall under this individual's purview.</p>
						<p>• Localization is a two-way street. While we introduce Americans to Bingsu, our HR manager ensures that our staff has a mix of native-born Americans. Their insights into local preferences are invaluable. Additionally, their role involves overall staff recruitment, training, and welfare, ensuring that our team remains motivated and efficient.</p>
